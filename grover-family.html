        <strong>Michael Grover has been living with brain cancer for 10 years, far longer than anyone expected. He attributes his survival to family support, great health care and generous medical insurance.</strong>
        <p>That reality makes debate about repeal of the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, more than just idle talk in the Grover household.</p>
        <p>Anxiously waiting to see what changes congressional Republicans will make to the health care law, Michael and his wife Lea say they have a lot to be concerned about. Their biggest worries: the return of lifetime caps in coverage and restrictions on coverage of pre-existing conditions, which could greatly impact his care, even though he has an employer-sponsored plan. Over the years, the family has accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in medical bills, much of which has been covered by insurance.</p>
        <p>Lea, an artist and writer, has been outspoken about access to affordable health care, penning a blog, “Repealing the Affordable Care Act will destroy my family.” Although U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) has refused to hold town halls on health care, activists twice have invited her to join them in meetings with the legislator who represents the 6th Congressional District.</p>
        <p>During one meeting, she confronted Roskam with a photo of her husband and three young daughters, telling him a yes vote on the Republican plan would impose a death sentence on people like her husband.</p>
        <strong>“(Roskam) told me my family mattered to him and then he turned around and voted to tear my family apart,” she says. “That makes him the worse kind of coward and hypocrite.”</strong>
        <p>Michael, a structural engineer, had a grand mal seizure during a company softball game on July 5, 2007. Brain scans detected cancer that was identified as glioblastoma.</p>
        <strong>He was told he had 18 months to live.</strong>
        <p>A decade later he is married and has fathered three daughters.</p>
        <p>Doctors can’t explain why Michael has survived so long but they are doing what they can to keep his cancer in check, he says. That means four to six preventive MRIs a year, at a cost of about $5,800 each, which he would be on the hook for if he didn’t have insurance. The brain scans detect whether his tumor is growing, which would require more surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatments.</p>
        <p>Survival carries a high price tag. His brain surgery and related hospital bills totaled about $180,000. Blood draws during radiation and chemotherapy added another $190 a week. For a time he wore a cutting-edge device to help him walk, billed at about $20,000 a month.</p>
        <strong>“Insurance has an out-of-pocket limit of $5,000 a year, which we hit in January every year,” he says.</strong>
        <p>At one point, after he was laid off from an earlier job, the couple paid $2,000 a month to keep his insurance going, which was “unfathomably expensive,” says Lea, unemployed at the time and pregnant with twins, who were born prematurely.</p>
        <p>Even though Lea and Michael, who live in Cary, are insured through his job right now, they worry about what would happen if he was laid off again and they needed to purchase insurance through Illinois’ health insurance marketplace. They also are concerned that changes made to the ACA could undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions or bring back lifetime caps on the dollar amount that insurers would pay for care, even for people with employer-sponsored plans. That’s what happened to many people before Obamacare.</p>
        <p>In its analysis, the Congressional Budget Office says that under the Senate version of the replace-and-repeal law, the ACA’s ban on annual and lifetime limits on covered benefits would no longer apply to health benefits not defined as essential in a state. As a result, some enrollees in nongroup insurance could see large increases in out-of-pocket spending for some benefits removed from a state’s definition of essential health benefits but not excluded from insurance coverage altogether. Essential health benefits include coverage for such things as prescription drug coverage, emergency services and hospitalization.</p>

        <p>Lea calls herself a walking pre-existing condition. She has a history of melanoma and postpartum depression and is a survivor of sexual violence. She’s had two C-sections and shoulder surgery. Her youngest daughter has a spinal cord disorder that might one day require surgery.  One of the twins, now 7, has asthma.</p>
        <p>“We are ridiculously privileged people,” Lea says. “We had two sets of more than comfortable parents and grandparents who were sacrificing outrageous amount of money to keep us solvent and in health care and that puts us in an extreme minority of the population. And we are incredibly aware of it. One of the reasons (Michael) is alive is that we have family that can pay for it. And the idea that we have the kind of country where you can only live if you can afford it is offensive in every way.”</p>
        <p>Even with financial support from family, the expensive treatments would be unaffordable without great insurance.</p>
        <strong>“We’ve been through a lot, and along the way we’ve seen people who don’t have the same advantages that we’ve had,” Michael says. “My diagnosis would bankrupt a lot of families. It would bankrupt ours if we didn’t have insurance.”</strong>
