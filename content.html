  <H2>THE STROJNY FAMILY</H2>

  <!-- Short version -->
  <article>
    <p>A lifelong Republican, Mike Strojny never expected to be waving a protest sign with a message directed at his Republican congressman. But he also didn’t expect U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam and the party leadership to turn their backs on people like him. Strojny was diagnosed with a progressive neurodegenerative disease in 2005 and now worries that the health care coverage he receives through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will be cut back or too costly to keep.</p>
    <p>Even though they don’t want to move, the Inverness couple have put their house up for sale to better prepare for future health care costs.</p>
    <p>“They are hurting so many people,” says Mike, who has spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, a genetic disorder that causes problems with the movement of muscles, including difficulty with coordination, balance, speech and swallowing. A hereditary condition, it afflicts other family members. His father died from it.</p>
    <p>His wife Laura, who had considered herself apolitical until recently, joined a group of demonstrators at Roskam’s 6th Congressional District office in West Chicago where they presented the staff with 60 rolls of toilet paper. Stick figures drawn on the sheets represented the estimated 60,000 people in the district who would lose coverage under the Republicans’ American Health Care Act.</p>
    <p>Their message to Roskam: “These are the people you are flushing away.”</p>

  <H2>THE SCIORTINO FAMILY</H2>

  <!-- Short version -->
  <article>
    <p>Gena Sciortino never wants her son Ian to go without health insurance. Ian was diagnosed with autism when he was 5, and Gena expected Medicaid to serve as a safety-net for her only son, who turns 26 in November and will no longer be eligible for coverage under his family’s health plan. He likely will never work full-time.</p>
    <p>But deep cuts to Medicaid proposed by congressional Republicans imperil his future health care.</p>
    <p>Gena, who lives in Fox River Grove with Ian, her husband Michael and her daughter Maggie, admits that the thought of Ian not being eligible for Medicaid “causes panic.”</p>
    <p>That’s why the private deal-making taking place behind closed doors in Washington is especially infuriating to her. U.S. Peter Roskam’s vote to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the American Health Care Act, which halts Medicaid expansion, was the last straw.</p>
    <p>“Peter Roskam needs to know that his constituents are aware,” she says, predicting the incumbent will face political consequences on Election Day, “and they are watching.”</p>

  <H2>THE GROVER FAMILY</H2>

  <!-- Short version -->
  <article>
    <p>Not one to mince words, Lea Grover shoved a photo of her husband and daughters in front of U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam and told him not to destroy her family. When he voted in favor of the Republicans’ American Health Care Act, she viewed it as a betrayal.</p>
    <p>For ten years her husband Michael has been living with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. That’s far longer than anyone expected. He was told he had only 18 months. He attributes his survival to family support, great health care and generous medical insurance.</p>
    <p>The Grovers, who live in Cary, are anxiously waiting to find out how Republicans will shape their repeal-and-replace legislation.</p>
    <p>Their biggest worries: the return of lifetime caps in coverage and restrictions on coverage of pre-existing conditions, which could greatly impact Michael’s care, even though he has an employer-sponsored plan. Over the years, the family has accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in medical bills, mostly covered by insurance.</p>
    <p>Lea says “the idea that we have the kind of country where you can only live if you can afford it is offensive in every way.”</p>
