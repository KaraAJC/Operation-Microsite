  <H2>THE STROJNY FAMILY</H2>

  <!-- Short version -->
  <article>
    <p>A lifelong Republican, Mike Strojny never expected to be waving a protest sign with a message directed at his Republican congressman. But he also didn’t expect U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam and the party leadership to turn their backs on people like him. Strojny was diagnosed with a progressive neurodegenerative disease in 2005 and now worries that the health care coverage he receives through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will be cut back or too costly to keep.</p>
    <p>Even though they don’t want to move, the Inverness couple have put their house up for sale to better prepare for future health care costs.</p>
    <p>“They are hurting so many people,” says Mike, who has spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, a genetic disorder that causes problems with the movement of muscles, including difficulty with coordination, balance, speech and swallowing. A hereditary condition, it afflicts other family members. His father died from it.</p>
    <p>His wife Laura, who had considered herself apolitical until recently, joined a group of demonstrators at Roskam’s 6th Congressional District office in West Chicago where they presented the staff with 60 rolls of toilet paper. Stick figures drawn on the sheets represented the estimated 60,000 people in the district who would lose coverage under the Republicans’ American Health Care Act.</p>
    <p>Their message to Roskam: “These are the people you are flushing away.”</p>

  <article>
    <p>When his father started showing symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease, Mike Strojny had no idea he was witnessing his own future.</p>
    <p>But in 2005, nine years after his father’s diagnosis, Mike learned that he too had spinocerebellar ataxia, or SCA type 1, a genetic disorder that causes progressive problems with muscle movement, including difficulty with coordination, balance, speech and swallowing.</p>
    <p>The diagnosis changed his life—and his politics.</p>
    <P>Mike, 61, and his wife Laura had not been politically active before. But in recent months they have not been shy about expressing their opinions publicly. Laura has participated in eight rallies since late last year, including three that the couple attended together.</P>
    <p>Mike’s eyes were opened during President Obama’s first-term when some congressional Republicans said they would do all they could to make sure he failed.</p>
    <p>“I remember the day I tore up my Republican card,” Mike says, recalling his disgust.</p>
    <p>Now when he hears about the backroom scheming underway on health reform it infuriates him even more. He says the GOP’s position on health care fails people when they are most vulnerable.</p>
    <p>His has plenty he wants to say to U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) after he voted to back a plan that would leave 23 million more people uninsured than under ACA.</p>
    <p>“They are hurting so many people,” says Mike, whose speech is slurred by his genetic disorder and who sometimes experiences painful muscle spasms.</p>
    <p>Laura joined a group of protesters at Roskam’s 6th Congressional District office in West Chicago where they presented the staff with 60 rolls of toilet paper. Stick figures drawn on the sheets represented the estimated 60,000 people in the district who would lose coverage under the Republicans’ American Health Care Act.</p>
    <p>Their message to Roskam: “These are the people you are flushing away,” Laura says.</p>
    <p>Laura, 58, a former elementary school teacher, retired in 2015 to spend more time with her husband. That same year, the couple purchased insurance from ACA, nicknamed Obamacare, through the Illinois health insurance marketplace. A subsidy covers most of the cost of their monthly premium. Mike is self-employed and the couple previously was covered by Laura’s employer-sponsored health insurance. They are too young for Medicare.</p>
    <p>They worry that their plan will not be affordable under a replace-and-repeal law. A Congressional Budget Office analysis predicts substantially smaller average subsidies for coverage under the Senate Republicans’ Better Care Reconciliation Act.</p>
    <p>“The reason I retired was because we knew we could apply for the ACA and have health care,” Laura says. Under draft legislation pushed by congressional Republicans, “our premiums would go up for sure.”</p>
    <p>Mike, who owns his own insurance company in Schaumburg, is semi-retired and works from home.</p>
    <p>Before his symptoms worsened, he golfed, coached youth football in Algonquin for 18 years and ran 5 to 10 miles a day. Now he uses a walker to get around. He can drive and ride a bike.</p>
    <p>Under the current political climate, people are made to feel like they are to blame for needing health care, as if they brought their health problems on themselves, he says. Yet that’s often not the case. SCA1, for example, is hereditary.</p>
    <p>After his father’s diagnosis, “they gave me the news that I had a 50 percent chance of having it,” Mike says. A DNA test later confirmed he had inherited it. One of his two sisters has it. The other one does not.</p>
    <p>Over time, individuals with SCA1 may develop numbness, tingling or pain in the arms and legs, uncontrolled muscle tensing, wasting and twitches. People with SCA1 typically survive 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear.</p>
    <p>The Strojny’s three adult children—34, 32 and 31—are at risk for the disorder. The couple worries that if any of them test positive, it would be considered a pre-existing condition and affect their ability to get insurance in the future.</p>
    <p>Current law prohibits the longstanding practice of charging people higher premiums if they have a pre-existing condition. The Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives would give states the option to charge higher premiums. The Senate version released in June would keep the ACA protections.</p>
    <p>Roskam voted in favor of the earlier bill that would do away with the guarantee that pre-existing conditions would not be penalized.</p>
    <p>The Strojnys say he turned his back on people like them.</p>
    <p>“We feel abandoned,” Laura says.</p>
    <p>The couple would like to remain in their Inverness home, with its rolling lawn and expansive views, but they put it on the market in June. They want to prepare for future health expenses. Due to the downturn in the real estate market years ago, they were forced to list it for $50,000 less than what they paid in 2005.</p>
    <p>Yet Mike worries more about others he considers to be worse off than him. He calls Roskam’s office regularly, once getting so emotional he burst into tears.</p>
    <p>At a rally earlier this year, the couple held colorful handmade signs poking at Roskam, Illinois Gov. Rauner and President Trump, calling them peas in a pod.</p>
    <p>Although he wasn’t an activist before, Mike says: “I want to be involved.”</p>

  <H2>THE SCIORTINO FAMILY</H2>

  <!-- Short version -->
  <article>
    <p>Gena Sciortino never wants her son Ian to go without health insurance. Ian was diagnosed with autism when he was 5, and Gena expected Medicaid to serve as a safety-net for her only son, who turns 26 in November and will no longer be eligible for coverage under his family’s health plan. He likely will never work full-time.</p>
    <p>But deep cuts to Medicaid proposed by congressional Republicans imperil his future health care.</p>
    <p>Gena, who lives in Fox River Grove with Ian, her husband Michael and her daughter Maggie, admits that the thought of Ian not being eligible for Medicaid “causes panic.”</p>
    <p>That’s why the private deal-making taking place behind closed doors in Washington is especially infuriating to her. U.S. Peter Roskam’s vote to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the American Health Care Act, which halts Medicaid expansion, was the last straw.</p>
    <p>“Peter Roskam needs to know that his constituents are aware,” she says, predicting the incumbent will face political consequences on Election Day, “and they are watching.”</p>

  <article>
    <p>Ian Sciortino never thinks about health insurance. But his devoted mother, Gena, realizes how devastating being uninsured could be for her only son.</p>
    <p>Diagnosed with autism when he was 5, Ian’s life revolves around watching old movies on TV, bagging groceries part-time in a neighborhood supermarket and playing with the family cat Frodo and rescue puppy Neptune.</p>
    <p>Gena has been counting on Medicaid as a safety-net for Ian, who turns 26 in November and will no longer be eligible for coverage under his family’s health plan. His social and communication skills are limited and he likely will never work full-time.</p>
    <p>With congressional Republicans proposing deep cuts to Medicaid, his future health care is in jeopardy.</p>
    <p>“Taking away our options for health care causes panic,” says Gena, who lives in Fox River Grove with Ian, her husband Michael and her oldest, daughter Maggie. “It takes away our sense of security.”</p>
    <p>U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL), has refused to hold town halls to hear from constituents in his 6th Congressional District. And he voted for the widely criticized American Health Care Act, the Republican’s first stab at gutting the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare.</p>
    <p>The private deal-making taking place among the small group of Republican legislators in Washington who are crafting a replace-and-repeal law angers Gena. Consequences will follow on Election Day, she predicts.</p>
    <p>“Peter Roskam needs to know that his constituents are aware,” she says, “and they are watching.”</p>
    <p>Even though Ian knew his alphabet by age 2 and could read company logos, his parents suspected something was wrong. He struggled with anxiety and was delayed in his speech and fine motor skills. As he got older he sometimes had unexpected outbursts, such as the day when his parents changed the route of their family walk and he started shrieking. Evaluations led to a diagnosis of autism.</p>
    <p>Ian attended regular classrooms during elementary and middle school where he received some special education services. He later attended a transitional program in high school, where the focus was on learning life-skills and preparing to work.</p>
    <p>When the Affordable Care Act became law, his parents were elated.</p>
    <p>“The Affordable Care Act provided some reassurance that Ian would be able to have health care coverage as he got older,” his mother says. “Should he be without health care simply because he was born with a disability? There are still a number of unknowns about his autism. … His coverage for health care shouldn't be another worry.”</p>
    <p>His mother applied for Medicaid for him at the end of last year and is waiting to hear back.  Even if he qualifies, she is not sure what that will mean.</p>
    <p>“Who knows what’s going to happen to Medicaid now,” she says.</p>
    <p>Providing coverage to 1 in 5 Americans, Medicaid is a lifeline for many low-income children, adults, seniors and people living with disabilities. The program, which is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, provides benefits for people with disabilities often not available or affordable through private coverage. Under Obamacare, Medicaid was expanded.</p>
    <p>The Republican plan, however, would cap the federal government’s portion of Medicaid funding and slash spending.</p>
    <p>Medicaid’s fate is just the latest uncertainty. When Gena’s company relocated to Peoria in April, she lost her administrative position and the family had to switch to her husband‘s insurance.</p>
    <p>They’ve seen family members battle health problems. Gena’s father died of Alzheimer’s disease. A year after her mother died of multiple system atrophy, a rare, degenerative neurological disorder, her sister was diagnosed with cancer that had spread from a lesion in one lung to her brain. Only 59 when she died, she had never smoked.</p>
    <p>“Health is something you sometimes have limited control over,” says Ian’s sister Maggie, 21, a college senior. “You can’t be guaranteed perfect health.”</p>
    <p>Doctors are still learning about autism, especially its impact on people as they age. Ian’s future health needs are hard to predict.</p>
    <p>“There’s a certain compassion for the disabled that the current (Trump) Administration seems to lack,” Gena says. “A functioning society has to take care of those who need assistance and may or may not be able to care for themselves. Ian is contributing. He works. He pays his taxes from his check. He helps support the union to which he belongs. But he can’t physically and mentally work at jobs full-time to provide insurance for himself.”</p>
    <p>Gena knows there may be a perception among some that someone who is young and can work shouldn’t rely on government programs like Medicaid to get by. But she says her son, who has a small frame for his age and is exceedingly polite, is doing his best. He is a hard worker who sometimes goes to work two hours early because he is obsessive about being on time.</p>
    <p>“He’s not being lazy or not trying. It’s just the circumstances,” she says.” We would love for him to be able to have a full-time job and support himself, but those are not the cards that we have been dealt.”</p>

  <H2>THE GROVER FAMILY</H2>

  <!-- Short version -->
  <article>
    <p>Not one to mince words, Lea Grover shoved a photo of her husband and daughters in front of U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam and told him not to destroy her family. When he voted in favor of the Republicans’ American Health Care Act, she viewed it as a betrayal.</p>
    <p>For ten years her husband Michael has been living with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. That’s far longer than anyone expected. He was told he had only 18 months. He attributes his survival to family support, great health care and generous medical insurance.</p>
    <p>The Grovers, who live in Cary, are anxiously waiting to find out how Republicans will shape their repeal-and-replace legislation.</p>
    <p>Their biggest worries: the return of lifetime caps in coverage and restrictions on coverage of pre-existing conditions, which could greatly impact Michael’s care, even though he has an employer-sponsored plan. Over the years, the family has accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in medical bills, mostly covered by insurance.</p>
    <p>Lea says “the idea that we have the kind of country where you can only live if you can afford it is offensive in every way.”</p>

  <p>Michael Grover has been living with brain cancer for 10 years, far longer than anyone expected. He attributes his survival to family support, great health care and generous medical insurance.</p>
  <p>That reality makes debate about repeal of the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, more than just idle talk in the Grover household.</p>
<p>Anxiously waiting to see what changes congressional Republicans will make to the health care law, Michael and his wife Lea say they have a lot to be concerned about. Their biggest worries: the return of lifetime caps in coverage and restrictions on coverage of pre-existing conditions, which could greatly impact his care, even though he has an employer-sponsored plan. Over the years, the family has accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in medical bills, much of which has been covered by insurance.</p>
Lea, an artist and writer, has been outspoken about access to affordable health care, penning a blog, “Repealing the Affordable Care Act will destroy my family.” Although U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) has refused to hold town halls on health care, activists twice have invited her to join them in meetings with the legislator who represents the 6th Congressional District.
During one meeting, she confronted Roskam with a photo of her husband and three young daughters, telling him a yes vote on the Republican plan would impose a death sentence on people like her husband.
“(Roskam) told me my family mattered to him and then he turned around and voted to tear my family apart,” she says. “That makes him the worse kind of coward and hypocrite.”
Michael, a structural engineer, had a grand mal seizure during a company softball game on July 5, 2007. Brain scans detected cancer that was identified as glioblastoma.
He was told he had 18 months to live.
A decade later he is married and has fathered three daughters.
Doctors can’t explain why Michael has survived so long but they are doing what they can to keep his cancer in check, he says. That means four to six preventive MRIs a year, at a cost of about $5,800 each, which he would be on the hook for if he didn’t have insurance. The brain scans detect whether his tumor is growing, which would require more surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatments.
Survival carries a high price tag. His brain surgery and related hospital bills totaled about $180,000. Blood draws during radiation and chemotherapy added another $190 a week. For a time he wore a cutting-edge device to help him walk, billed at about $20,000 a month.
“Insurance has an out-of-pocket limit of $5,000 a year, which we hit in January every year,” he says.
At one point, after he was laid off from an earlier job, the couple paid $2,000 a month to keep his insurance going, which was “unfathomably expensive,” says Lea, unemployed at the time and pregnant with twins, who were born prematurely.
Even though Lea and Michael, who live in Cary, are insured through his job right now, they worry about what would happen if he was laid off again and they needed to purchase insurance through Illinois’ health insurance marketplace. They also are concerned that changes made to the ACA could undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions or bring back lifetime caps on the dollar amount that insurers would pay for care, even for people with employer-sponsored plans. That’s what happened to many people before Obamacare.
In its analysis, the Congressional Budget Office says that under the Senate version of the replace-and-repeal law, the ACA’s ban on annual and lifetime limits on covered benefits would no longer apply to health benefits not defined as essential in a state. As a result, some enrollees in nongroup insurance could see large increases in out-of-pocket spending for some benefits removed from a state’s definition of essential health benefits but not excluded from insurance coverage altogether. Essential health benefits include coverage for such things as prescription drug coverage, emergency services and hospitalization.

Lea calls herself a walking pre-existing condition. She has a history of melanoma and postpartum depression and is a survivor of sexual violence. She’s had two C-sections and shoulder surgery. Her youngest daughter has a spinal cord disorder that might one day require surgery.  One of the twins, now 7, has asthma.

“We are ridiculously privileged people,” Lea says. “We had two sets of more than comfortable parents and grandparents who were sacrificing outrageous amount of money to keep us solvent and in health care and that puts us in an extreme minority of the population. And we are incredibly aware of it. One of the reasons (Michael) is alive is that we have family that can pay for it. And the idea that we have the kind of country where you can only live if you can afford it is offensive in every way.”
Even with financial support from family, the expensive treatments would be unaffordable without great insurance.
“We’ve been through a lot, and along the way we’ve seen people who don’t have the same advantages that we’ve had,” Michael says. “My diagnosis would bankrupt a lot of families. It would bankrupt ours if we didn’t have insurance.”
