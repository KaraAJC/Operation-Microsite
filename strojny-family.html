      <H2>THE STROJNY FAMILY</H2>
      <article>
        <p>When his father started showing symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease, Mike Strojny had no idea he was witnessing his own future.</p>
        <p>But in 2005, nine years after his father’s diagnosis, Mike learned that he too had spinocerebellar ataxia, or SCA type 1, a genetic disorder that causes progressive problems with muscle movement, including difficulty with coordination, balance, speech and swallowing.</p>
        <p>The diagnosis changed his life—and his politics.</p>
        <P>Mike, 61, and his wife Laura had not been politically active before. But in recent months they have not been shy about expressing their opinions publicly. Laura has participated in eight rallies since late last year, including three that the couple attended together.</P>
        <p>Mike’s eyes were opened during President Obama’s first-term when some congressional Republicans said they would do all they could to make sure he failed.</p>
        <p>“I remember the day I tore up my Republican card,” Mike says, recalling his disgust.</p>
        <p>Now when he hears about the backroom scheming underway on health reform it infuriates him even more. He says the GOP’s position on health care fails people when they are most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>His has plenty he wants to say to U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) after he voted to back a plan that would leave 23 million more people uninsured than under ACA.</p>
        <p>“They are hurting so many people,” says Mike, whose speech is slurred by his genetic disorder and who sometimes experiences painful muscle spasms.</p>
        <p>Laura joined a group of protesters at Roskam’s 6th Congressional District office in West Chicago where they presented the staff with 60 rolls of toilet paper. Stick figures drawn on the sheets represented the estimated 60,000 people in the district who would lose coverage under the Republicans’ American Health Care Act.</p>
        <p>Their message to Roskam: “These are the people you are flushing away,” Laura says.</p>
        <p>Laura, 58, a former elementary school teacher, retired in 2015 to spend more time with her husband. That same year, the couple purchased insurance from ACA, nicknamed Obamacare, through the Illinois health insurance marketplace. A subsidy covers most of the cost of their monthly premium. Mike is self-employed and the couple previously was covered by Laura’s employer-sponsored health insurance. They are too young for Medicare.</p>
        <p>They worry that their plan will not be affordable under a replace-and-repeal law. A Congressional Budget Office analysis predicts substantially smaller average subsidies for coverage under the Senate Republicans’ Better Care Reconciliation Act.</p>
        <p>“The reason I retired was because we knew we could apply for the ACA and have health care,” Laura says. Under draft legislation pushed by congressional Republicans, “our premiums would go up for sure.”</p>
        <p>Mike, who owns his own insurance company in Schaumburg, is semi-retired and works from home.</p>
        <p>Before his symptoms worsened, he golfed, coached youth football in Algonquin for 18 years and ran 5 to 10 miles a day. Now he uses a walker to get around. He can drive and ride a bike.</p>
        <p>Under the current political climate, people are made to feel like they are to blame for needing health care, as if they brought their health problems on themselves, he says. Yet that’s often not the case. SCA1, for example, is hereditary.</p>
        <p>After his father’s diagnosis, “they gave me the news that I had a 50 percent chance of having it,” Mike says. A DNA test later confirmed he had inherited it. One of his two sisters has it. The other one does not.</p>
        <p>Over time, individuals with SCA1 may develop numbness, tingling or pain in the arms and legs, uncontrolled muscle tensing, wasting and twitches. People with SCA1 typically survive 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear.</p>
        <p>The Strojny’s three adult children—34, 32 and 31—are at risk for the disorder. The couple worries that if any of them test positive, it would be considered a pre-existing condition and affect their ability to get insurance in the future.</p>
        <p>Current law prohibits the longstanding practice of charging people higher premiums if they have a pre-existing condition. The Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives would give states the option to charge higher premiums. The Senate version released in June would keep the ACA protections.</p>
        <p>Roskam voted in favor of the earlier bill that would do away with the guarantee that pre-existing conditions would not be penalized.</p>
        <p>The Strojnys say he turned his back on people like them.</p>
        <p>“We feel abandoned,” Laura says.</p>
        <p>The couple would like to remain in their Inverness home, with its rolling lawn and expansive views, but they put it on the market in June. They want to prepare for future health expenses. Due to the downturn in the real estate market years ago, they were forced to list it for $50,000 less than what they paid in 2005.</p>
        <p>Yet Mike worries more about others he considers to be worse off than him. He calls Roskam’s office regularly, once getting so emotional he burst into tears.</p>
        <p>At a rally earlier this year, the couple held colorful handmade signs poking at Roskam, Illinois Gov. Rauner and President Trump, calling them peas in a pod.</p>
        <p>Although he wasn’t an activist before, Mike says: “I want to be involved.”</p>
